(Caused by SSLError(SSLEOFError(8, 'EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:1131)'))) Recent studies have shown that the transcription factor , nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , regulates critical survival pathways in a variety of different cell types , including human pancreatic cancer cells . The activation of NF-kappaB is controlled by proteasome-mediated degradation of its endogenous polypeptide inhibitor , inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaBalpha . We investigated the effects of PS-341 , a peptide boronate inhibitor of the proteasome in human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo . Comparison of PS-341's effects on the growth of eight different human pancreatic cancer cell lines revealed marked heterogeneity in drug responsiveness , ranging from highly resistant ( IC50 > 10 microM ; Panc-48 , HS766T , and Mia-PaCa-2 ) to extremely sensitive ( IC50 < 40 nM ; L3.6pl , Hpaf2 , and BxPC3 ) . However , these effects did not correlate with differential inhibition of NF-kappaB activation . Direct quantification of apoptosis revealed that PS-341's effects on cell growth largely correlated with sensitivity to programmed cell death . Evaluation of PS-341's effects on established orthotopic tumor xenografts demonstrated that biweekly intravenous administration of the maximum-tolerated dose of the drug ( 1 mg/kg ) led to significant reductions in the volumes of L3.6pl tumors but not Mia-PaCa-2 tumors . Laser scanning cytometer-mediated quantification of drug-induced apoptosis in the xenografts confirmed that PS-341 induced DNA fragmentation and activation of caspase-3 in L3.6pl tumors but not in Mia-PaCa-2 tumors . However , histological examination of drug-treated tumors revealed extensive central necrosis and reductions in microvessel density and VEGF expression in both tumor types . Taken together , our results demonstrate that PS-341 inhibits the growth of human pancreatic tumors via direct effects on tumor cells and indirect effects on the tumor vasculature .

Expression of this integrin is altered by chemical and viral transformation , suggesting that FNR dysfunction may play a role in growth control . This study demonstrates that exposing FA-K562 cells to glycine-arginine-glycine-aspartate-serine ( GRGDS ) , a peptide ligand of the FNR , specifically stimulates p34/cdc2- and cyclin A-associated kinase activities . This occurs within 2 h of peptide addition . The 110-kDa form of the retinoblastoma protein appears within 3 h of GRGDS addition , consistent with activation of a G1/S kinase . DNA staining profiles demonstrate that GRGDS induces cell cycle progression within 24 h . Increased anchorage-independent growth is subsequently observed in GRGDS-treated FA-K562 cells . The control peptide , GRGES , which cannot bind the FNR , has none of these effects . This demonstrates that an extracellular integrin ligand can regulate cell proliferation . Furthermore , these results suggest that integrins link the extracellular environment and intracellular growth regulators .

Enhanced levels of activated p38 isoforms have been linked with poor prognosis in breast cancer , although the mechanistic basis for this association is poorly understood . In this study , we report that p38 activation in cervical cancer cells is driven by osteopontin ( OPN ) , an extracellular matrix-associated cytokine that drives invasive progression . OPN regulates CD44-mediated p38 phosphorylation that induces NF-κB activation and NF-κB-dependent expression of furin , an extracellular protease implicated in human papilloma virus ( HPV ) processing that enhances cervical cancer cell motility . OPN induces CD44-mediated MKK3/6 phosphorylation which in turn phosphorylates p38 in these cells . OPN-induced furin expression and cell motility was impeded by blockades to MKK3/6 , p38α/β or NF-κB signaling . In a mouse xenograft model of human cervical cancer , tumor growth was enhanced by OPN overexpression and blocked by short hairpin RNA ( shRNA)-mediated OPN silencing . Furin overexpression similarly augmented tumor growth in the model , whereas blocking MKK3/6 , p38 , or furin reduced OPN-induced cervical tumor growth . Analysis of clinical specimens revealed that enhanced expression of OPN , phosphorylated NF-κB , p65 , and furin correlated with cervical cancer progression , further strengthening the in vitro and in vivo results . In summary , our findings offer a proof of concept for targeting OPN and its downstream p38 signaling as a novel therapeutic strategy to manage cervical cancer .

Here we show that 4E-BP1 , one major repressor of cap-dependent translation , plays a critical role in density-mediated cell cycle arrest. 4E-BP1 promoter is activated and 4E-BP1 protein amount increases as cells reach confluence . Conversely , a much less marked density-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation is observed upon 4E-BP1 silencing . We further show that at high density , progression through the G₁ phase of the cell cycle is faster and Cyclin D1 protein is induced in different cell types where 4E-BP1 has been either downregulated ( stable shRNA expression or transient siRNA transfection ) or removed ( knock-out ) . Thus 4E-BP1 appears as an important mediator of contact inhibition .

Flt-1 and Flk-1 , the major vascular endothelial growth factor receptors involved in angiogenesis and hyperpermeability , may play a potent role in determining peritoneal transport characteristics . However , the relationship between them has not been studied to date . We hypothesized that Flt-1 and Flk-1 expression in the peritoneal vasculature of uremic patients could be closely related to baseline peritoneal transport status . METHODS Thirty-six new patients without a previous history of peritonitis were enrolled . Clinical parameters such as age , sex , height , weight , causes of renal failure , and residual renal function were assessed . Parietal peritoneal biopsies were obtained during implantation of peritoneal dialytic catheters . Flt-1 and Flk-1 were semi-quantitatively evaluated by immunohistochemical staining . Peritoneal microvascular density ( MVD ) was counted . Within 6 weeks after commencing peritoneal dialysis , a standard peritoneal equilibration test was performed , and the dialysate-to-plasma concentration ratio for creatinine at 4 h ( D4/P Cr ) was determined . The patients were divided into two groups based on the D4/P Cr : more than 0.65 ( Group H , n = 22 ) and less than or equal to 0.65 ( Group L , n = 14 ) . The 24-h peritoneal protein excretion ( PPE ) was assayed . Flt-1 and Flk-1 were correlated with peritoneal MVD , D4/P Cr , and PPE . RESULTS Flt-1 and Flk-1 were detected in the peritoneal vasculature of uremic patients . Flt-1 expression was similar between the two groups , but Flk-1 expression in Group H was significantly higher than that in Group L ( p = 0.001 ) . Flt-1 expression did not show significant correlations with peritoneal MVD , D4/P Cr , and PPE . However , Flk-1 expression showed significant correlations with the above three parameters ( p < 0.001 for all ) . CONCLUSIONS For the first time , the expressions of Flt-1 and Flk-1 in peritoneal vasculature of uremic patients were detected . Flk-1 expression in peritoneal vasculature of uremic patients is closely correlated with the number of peritoneal microvessels , peritoneal small solute transport rate , and PPE . Our findings strongly suggest that Flk-1 may be a crucial determinant of baseline peritoneal transport characteristics . Further interventional studies are needed .

In this study , array CGH and PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations were used to drive patients into targeted therapy . A prospective molecular analysis was offered to metastatic breast cancer patients for whom samples were collected prospectively or retrospectively either from frozen or paraffin-embedded tissue . Analyses were performed using array CGH ( Agilent platform ) and PIK3CA ( exon 10 and 21 ) and AKT1 mutations were explored by standard Sanger sequencing . One hundred and eight patients were included . Good quality CGH was obtained in 79% cases and was better for frozen samples . Genomic alterations were identified in 50% of patients including 11 PIK3CA and 8 AKT1 mutations . Eighteen treatments ( 17 patients ) were administered according to their molecular profile with evidence of activity in nine . Reasons for not providing a genomic-driven treatment included absence of progressive disease ( 38% ) , investigator's choice ( 9% ) , rapid PD ( 19% ) , and no drug access ( 21% ) . Array CGH correctly identified Her2 status in 97% cases ; failures were related to low % of tumour cells . Our study showed that array CGH is feasible in the context of daily practice and , in combination with PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations , identifies a significant number of actionable molecular alterations that allow driving patients into specific targeted agents .

However , the mechanisms by which androgens exert their regulatory activities on these processes are poorly understood . In this study , we have determined that androgens regulate overall cell metabolism and cell growth , in part , by increasing autophagy in prostate cancer cells . Importantly , inhibition of autophagy using either pharmacological or molecular inhibitors significantly abrogated androgen-induced prostate cancer cell growth . Mechanistically , androgen-mediated autophagy appears to promote cell growth by augmenting intracellular lipid accumulation , an effect previously demonstrated to be necessary for prostate cancer cell growth . Further , autophagy and subsequent cell growth is potentiated , in part , by androgen-mediated increases in reactive oxygen species . These findings demonstrate a role for increased fat metabolism and autophagy in prostatic neoplasias and highlight the potential of targeting underexplored metabolic pathways for the development of novel therapeutics .

Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive type of primary brain tumors in humans . In this study , we introduce oxidative stress-energy depletion ( OSED ) therapy as a new suggested treatment for glioblastoma . OSED utilizes D-amino acid oxidase ( DAO ) , which is a promising therapeutic protein that induces oxidative stress and apoptosis through generating hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) . OSED combines DAO with 3-bromopyruvate ( 3BP ) , a hexokinase II ( HK II ) inhibitor that interferes with Warburg effect , a metabolic alteration of most tumor cells that is characterized by enhanced aerobic glycolysis . Our data revealed that 3BP induced depletion of energetic capabilities of glioma cells. 3BP induced H2O2 production as a novel mechanism of its action . C6 glioma transfected with DAO and treated with D-serine together with 3BP-sensitized glioma cells to 3BP and decreased markedly proliferation , clonogenic power and viability in a three-dimensional tumor model with lesser effect on normal astrocytes . DAO gene therapy using atelocollagen as an in vivo transfection agent proved effective in a glioma tumor model in Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) rats , especially after combination with 3BP . OSED treatment was safe and tolerable in SD rats . OSED therapy may be a promising therapeutic modality for glioma .

fibroblasts and endothelial cells . We further investigated these relationships by suppressing stromal cell growth through the inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) . STUDY DESIGN Preclinical investigation . METHODS HNSCC cell lines ( FADU , OSC19 , Cal27 , SCC1 , SCC5 , SCC22A ) , fibroblast ( HS27 ) , and endothelial cells ( human umbilical vascular endothelial cell ) were cultured individually or in coculture . Proliferation was assessed following treatment with a range of physiologic concentrations of FGFR inhibitor PD173074 . Mice bearing established HNSCC xenografts were treated with PD173074 ( 12 mg/kg ) , and tumor histology was analyzed for stromal composition , proliferation ( Ki67 staining ) , and apoptosis ( TUNEL [ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling ] staining ) . RESULTS In vitro , inhibition of FGFR with PD173074 dramatically reduced proliferation of fibroblasts and endothelial cells compared to untreated controls . However , HNSCC cell proliferation was not affected by inhibition of FGFR . When cocultured with fibroblasts , HNSCC cells proliferation increased by 15% to 80% ( P < .01 ) . Furthermore , this fibroblast-enhanced tumor cell growth was suppressed by FGFR inhibition . Additionally , treatment of mice bearing HNSCC xenografts with PD173074 resulted in significant growth inhibition ( P < .001 ) . Additionally , those tumors from mice treated with PD173074 had a smaller stromal component , decreased proliferation , and increased apoptosis . CONCLUSIONS Targeting the FGFR pathway in head and neck cancer acts through the stromal components to decrease HNSCC growth in vivo and in vitro .

It has also been reported that vitexicarpin can inhibit the growth of various cancer cells . However , there is no report elucidating its effect on human prostate carcinoma cells . The aim of the present study was to examine the apoptotic induction activity of vitexicarpin on PC-3 cells and molecular mechanisms involved . MTT studies showed that vitexicarpin dose-dependently inhibited growth of PC-3 cells with an IC50 μM . Hoechst 33258 staining further revealed that vitexicarpin induced apoptotic cell death . The effect of vitexicarpin on PC-3 cells apoptosis was tested using prodium iodide ( PI)/Annexin V-FITC double staining and flow cytometry . The results indicated that vitexicarpin induction of apoptotic cell death in PC-3 cells was accompanied by cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase . Furthermore , our study demonstrated that vitexicarpin induction of PC-3 cell apoptosis was associated with upregulation of the proapoptotic protein Bax , and downregulation of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 , release of Cytochrome c from mitochondria and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential . Our findings suggested that vitexicarpin may become a potential leading drug in the therapy of prostate carcinoma .

An element in the region responsible for premature termination of transcription mediates a rapid repression of c-myc gene expression by T3 . The hormone also causes a decrease of cyclin D1 gene transcription , and is able to antagonize the activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by Ras . In addition , a strong and sustained increase of the levels of the cyclin kinase inhibitor ( CKI ) p27(Kip1) are found in T3-treated cells . The increased levels of p27(Kip1) lead to a marked inhibition of the kinase activity of the cyclin-CDK2 complexes . As a consequence of these changes , retinoblastoma proteins are hypophosphorylated in T3-treated N2a-beta cells , and progression through the restriction point in the cell cycle is blocked .

The purpose of the current study is to investigate the role of new lncRNA , named PlncRNA-1 , in prostate cancer ( CaP ) pathogenesis . MATERIALS AND METHODS : In this study , real-time q-PCR was used to demonstrate the expression of PlncRNA-1 in 16 pairs CaP tissues and matched normal tissues , 14 pairs CaP tissues and BPH tissues , 4 CaP cell lines , including LNCaP , LNCaP-AI , PC3 , and C4-2 , and 2 normal prostate epithelial cell lines RWPE-1 and PWR-1E . After PlncRNA-1 was suppressed by siRNA in LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cell lines , cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed using CCK-8 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) . After PlncRNA-1 and AR was suppressed by siRNA in LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cell lines , real-time q-PCR and Western blotting were used to measure reciprocal regulation of PlncRNA-1 and AR . RESULTS : We showed that expression PlncRNA-1 , was significantly higher in CaP cells relative to normal prostate epithelial cells , as well as higher in human CaPs compared with normal tissues and benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) . Silencing of PlncRNA-1 significantly reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in CaP cell lines LNCaP and LNCaP-AI . Mechanistically , PlncRNA-1 suppression by siRNA resulted in a decrease of androgen receptor ( AR ) mRNA , protein and AR downstream target . Of note , blockade of AR signaling with siRNA also resulted in a suppression of PlncRNA-1 expression in CaP cell lines . CONCLUSIONS : Our study suggests reciprocal regulation of PlncRNA-1 and androgen receptor contribute to CaP pathogenesis and that PlncRNA-1 is a potential therapy target .

PKI 166 is used to determine the effects of redox sensitive inhibition of EGFR , metastasis and apoptosis in epidermoid carcinoma . Cytotoxicity study of PKI 166 ( IC50 1.0 microM ) treated A431 cells were performed by MTT assay for 48 and 72 hrs . Morphological analysis of PKI 166 treated A431 cells for 48 hrs. revealed the cell shrinkage , loss of filopodia and lamellipodia by phase contrast and SEM images in dose dependent manner . It has cytotoxic effects through inhibiting cellular proliferation , leads to the induction of apoptosis , as increased fraction of sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle , chromatin condensation and DNA ladder . It inhibited cyclin-D1 and cyclin-E expression and induced p53 , p21 expression in dose dependent manner . Consequently , an imbalance of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio triggered caspase cascade and subsequent cleavage of PARP , thereby shifting the balance in favour of apoptosis . PKI 166 treatment actively stimulated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and mitochondrial membrane depolarization . It inhibited some metastatic properties of A431 cells supressing colony formation by soft agar assay and inhibition of MMP 9 activity by gelatin zymography and western blot analysis . PKI 166 inhibited growth factor induced phosphorylation of EGFR , Akt , MAPK , JNK and colony formation in A431 cells . Thus the inhibition of proliferation was associated with redox regulation of the caspase cascade , EGFR , Akt/PI3K , MAPK/ ERK and JNK pathway . On the other hand , increased antioxidant activity leads to decreased ROS generation inhibit the anti-proliferative and apoptotic properties of PKI 166 in A431 cells . These observations indicated PKI 166 induced redox signalling dependent inhibition of cell proliferation , metastatic properties and induction of apoptotic potential in epidermoid carcinoma .

Overexpressed in over 30% of breast cancers , IKKε has been recently identified as a potential breast cancer oncogene . The purpose of this study is to examine the therapeutic potential of IKKε siRNA on human breast cancer cells . METHODS Eight siRNAs targeting different regions of the IKKε mRNA were designed , and the silencing effect was screened by quantitative real time RT-PCR . The biological effects of synthetic siRNAs on human breast cancer cells were investigated by examining the cell proliferation , migration , invasion , focus formation , anchorage-independent growth(via soft agar assay ) , cell cycle arrest , apoptosis ( via annexing binding ) , NF-κB basal level , and NF-κB related gene expressions upon the IKKε silencing . RESULTS Silencing of IKKε in human breast cancer cells resulted in decrease of focus formation potential and clonogenicity as well as in vitro cell migration/invasion capabilities . Moreover , knockdown of IKKε suppressed cell proliferation . Cell cycle assay showed that the anti-proliferation effect of IKKε siRNA was mediated by arresting cells in G(0)/G(1) phase , which was caused by down-regulation of cyclin D(1) . Furthermore , we demonstrated that silencing of IKKε inhibited the NF-κB basal activity as well as the Bcl-2 expression . Significant apoptosis was not observed in breast cancer cells upon the silencing of IKKε . The present study provided the first evidence that silencing IKKε using synthetic siRNA could inhibit the invasiveness properties and proliferation of breast cancer cells . CONCLUSIONS Our results suggested that silencing IKKε using synthetic siRNA may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for breast cancer .

We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of elements of the IGF axis , matrilysin , overexpression of p53 and the methylation status of the IGFBP-3 promoter in 80 surgically resected BTC . We also assessed the effect of IGF-IR blockade on signal transduction , proliferation and survival in three BTC cell lines using a new tyrosine kinase inhibitor , BMS-536924 , and dominant negative IGF-IR ( IGF-IR/dn ) . The effects of IGF-IR blockade was also studied in nude mouse xenograft models . IGF-I was expressed in 60% and IGF-II in 50% of tumors . High expression was associated with tumor size . IGF-IR was expressed in 69% of the cases and was associated with advanced stage and matrilysin expression . Hypermethylation of the IGFBP-3 promoter was detected in 41% of BTC and was inversely correlated with p53 expression . BMS-536924 blocked autophosphorylation of IGF-IR and both Akt and ERK activation by both IGF-I and insulin . BMS-536924 suppressed proliferation and tumorigenicity in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion . This inhibitor upregulated chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion . Moreover , IGF-IR blockade was effective against tumors in mice . IGF-IR might identify a subset of BTC with a particularly aggressive phenotype and is a candidate therapeutic target in this disease . BMS-536924 might have significant therapeutic utility .

The inactivation of multiple pathways that positively regulate senescence are required for immortalization . To identify these pathways in an unbiased manner , we performed DNA microarray analyses to assess the expression of 20,000 genes in human prostate epithelial cells ( HPECs ) passaged to senescence . These gene expression patterns were then compared with those of HPECs immortalized with the human Papillomavirus 16 E7 oncoprotein . Senescent cells display gene expression patterns that reflect their nonproliferative , differentiated phenotype and express secretory proteases and extracellular matrix components . A comparison of genes transcriptionally up-regulated in senescence to those in which expression is significantly down-regulated in immortalized HPECs identified three genes : the chemokine BRAK , DOC1 , and a member of the insulin-like growth factor axis , IGFBP-3 . Expression of these genes is found to be uniformly lost in human prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts , and previously , their inactivation was documented in tumor samples . Thus , these genes may function in novel pathways that regulate senescence and are inactivated during immortalization . These changes may be critical not only in allowing cells to bypass senescence in vitro but in the progression of prostate cancer in vivo .

Here , we investigated mechanisms of p53 activation by the free radical , NO . NO from donor drugs induced both ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM)- and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related-dependent p53 posttranslational modifications , leading to an increase in p53 transcriptional targets and a G(2)M cell cycle checkpoint . Such modifications were also identified in cells cocultured with NO-releasing macrophages . In noncancerous colon tissues from patients with ulcerative colitis ( a cancer-prone chronic inflammatory disease ) , inducible NO synthase protein levels were positively correlated with p53 serine 15 phosphorylation levels . Immunostaining of HDM-2 and p21(WAF1) was consistent with transcriptionally active p53 . Our study highlights a pivotal role of NO in the induction of cellular stress and the activation of a p53 response pathway during chronic inflammation .

By using a specific antagonist that binds the C-terminal tail of nucleolin , the HB-19 pseudopeptide , we recently reported that HB-19 treatment markedly suppressed the progression of established human breast tumor cell xenografts in the athymic nude mice without apparent toxicity . METHODS The in vivo antitumoral action of HB-19 treatment was assessed on the spontaneous development of melanoma in the RET transgenic mouse model . Ten days old RET mice were treated with HB-19 in a prophylactic setting that extended 300 days . In parallel , the molecular basis for the action of HB-19 was investigated on a melanoma cell line ( called TIII ) derived from a cutaneous nodule of a RET mouse . RESULTS HB-19 treatment of RET mice caused a significant delay in the onset of cutaneous tumors , several-months delay in the incidence of large tumors , a lower frequency of cutaneous nodules , and a reduction of visceral metastatic nodules while displaying no toxicity to normal tissue . Moreover , microvessel density was significantly reduced in tumors recovered from HB-19 treated mice compared to corresponding controls . Studies on the melanoma-derived tumor cells demonstrated that HB-19 treatment of TIII cells could restore contact inhibition , impair anchorage-independent growth , and reduce their tumorigenic potential in mice . Moreover , HB-19 treatment caused selective down regulation of transcripts coding matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 , and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the TIII cells and in melanoma tumors of RET mice . CONCLUSIONS Although HB-19 treatment failed to prevent the development of spontaneous melanoma in the RET mice , it delayed for several months the onset and frequency of cutaneous tumors , and exerted a significant inhibitory effect on visceral metastasis . Consequently , HB-19 could provide a novel therapeutic agent by itself or as an adjuvant therapy in association with current therapeutic interventions on a virulent cancer like melanoma .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Major clinico-pathological factors including therapeutic modalities and survival status of 371 breast cancer patients with HER2 over-expression , teated at Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital from March of 2002 to December of 2010 were retrospectively studied , with special attention focused on survival-related factors . RESULTS The median age of the total 371 patients in this study was 48 years at time of diagnosis , among which , the leading pathological type was infiltrating ductal carcinoma ( 92.5% ) ; 62.8% presented with a primary tomor larger than 2 cm in diameter at diagnosis , 51.0% had axillary lymph node ( ALN ) metastases ; ER ( Estrogen receptor ) /PR ( Progesterone receptor ) double negative occured in 52.8% of cases , and PCNA ( proliferation cell nuclear antigen ) ( + + + ) was found in 55.1% . HER-2 overexpressed patients were usually in advanced stage when the diagnosis was made ( 72.8% at stages IIA The prognosis and survival were assessed in 259 patients with complete follow-up data. 5-year DFS ( disease-free survival ) and OS ( overall survival ) rate was 68.0% and 78.0% respectively . Univariate analysis revealed that age , tumor size , ALN metastases , LVSI ( lymph-vascular space involvement ) , PCNA status , hormonal therapy , chemotherapy cycles , and HER-2 overexpression , correlated closely with the prognosis . ALN metastases , LVSI , PCNA status and chemotherapy cycles were independent predictors of survival . CONCLUSIONS HER-2 overexpressed breast cancer has special clinical and pathological characteristics , with advanced clinical stages and high rate of ER/PR double negative . Lymph node metastases , LVSI , PCNA and chemotherapy cycles are independent predictors of prognosis .

AR is re-activated through multiple mechanisms including expression of constitutively active splice variants that lack hormone binding domains ( HBDs ) . This highlights need to develop therapies that target regions other than the HBD . Because the p160 coactivators interact most strongly with the amino-terminus of AR , we examined the consequences of disrupting this interaction . We identified two overlapping SRC-1 peptides that interact with AR , but not with progesterone receptor . These peptides reduce AR and AR variant AR-V7 dependent induction of an AR responsive reporter . Using mammalian two hybrid assays , we found that the peptides interrupt the AR/SRC-1 , AR/SRC-2 and AR N/C interactions , but not SRC-1/CARM-1 interactions . Consistent with the SRC-1 dependence of induced , but not repressed genes , in LNCaP cells , the peptides inhibited hormone dependent induction of endogenous target genes including PSA and TMPRSS2 , but did not block AR dependent repression of UGT2B17 or inhibit vitamin D receptor activity . Simultaneous detection of SRC-1 peptides and PSA by double immunofluorescence in transfected LNCaP cells clearly demonstrated a strong reduction in PSA levels in cells expressing the peptides . The peptides also inhibited the AR dependent expression of PSA in castration resistant C4-2 cells . Moreover they inhibited androgen dependent proliferation of LNCaP cells and proliferation of C4-2 cells in androgen depleted medium without affecting AR negative PC-3 cells . Thus , the p160 coactivator binding site is a novel potential therapeutic target to inhibit AR activity .

Vice versa , transformed cells are characterised by a loss of contact-inhibition . Despite its generally accepted importance for cell-cycle control , little is known about the intracellular signalling pathways involved in contact-inhibition . Unravelling the molecular mechanisms of contact-inhibition and its loss during tumourigenesis will be an important step towards the identification of novel target genes in tumour diagnosis and treatment . To better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms we identified the transcriptional programme of contact-inhibition in NIH3T3 fibroblast using high-density microarrays . Setting the cut off : >or=1.5-fold , P <or= 0.05 , 853 genes and 73 cDNA sequences were differentially expressed in confluent compared to exponentially growing cultures . Importing these data into GenMAPP software revealed a comprehensive list of cell-cycle regulatory genes mediating G0/G1 arrest , which was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot . In a narrow analysis ( cut off : >or=2-fold , P <or= 0.002 ) , we found 110 transcripts to be differentially expressed representing 107 genes and 3 cDNA sequences involved , for example , in proliferation , signal transduction , transcriptional regulation , cell adhesion and communication . Interestingly , the majority of genes was upregulated indicating that contact-inhibition is not a passive state , but actively induced . Furthermore , we confirmed differential expression of eight genes by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and identified the potential tumour suppressor transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta)-1-induced clone 22 ( TSC-22 ; tgfb1i4 ) as a novel protein to be induced in contact-inhibited cells .

(Caused by SSLError(SSLEOFError(8, 'EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:1131)'))) BACKGROUND To investigate the dynamics of inter- and intratumoral molecular alterations during tumor progression in recurrent gliomas . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS To address intertumoral heterogeneity we investigated non-microdissected tumor tissue of 106 gliomas representing 51 recurrent tumors . To address intratumoral heterogeneity a set of 16 gliomas representing 7 tumor pairs with at least one recurrence , and 4 single mixed gliomas were investigated by microdissection of distinct oligodendroglial and astrocytic tumor components . All tumors and tumor components were analyzed for allelic loss of 1p/19q ( LOH 1p/19q ) , for TP53- mutations and for R132 mutations in the IDH1 gene . The investigation of non-microdissected tumor tissue revealed clonality in 75% ( 38/51 ) . Aberrant molecular alterations upon recurrence were detected in 25% ( 13/51). 64% ( 9/14 ) of these were novel and associated with tumor progression . Loss of previously detected alterations was observed in 36% ( 5/14 ) . One tumor pair ( 1/14 ; 7% ) was significant for both . Intratumoral clonality was detected in 57% ( 4/7 ) of the microdissected tumor pairs and in 75% ( 3/4 ) of single microdissected tumors. 43% ( 3/7 ) of tumor pairs and one single tumor ( 25% ) revealed intratumoral heterogeneity . While intratumoral heterogeneity affected both the TP53- mutational status and the LOH1p/19q status , all tumors with intratumoral heterogeneity shared the R132 IDH1- mutation as a common feature in both their microdissected components . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE The majority of recurrent gliomas are of monoclonal origin . However , the detection of divertive tumor cell clones in morphological distinct tumor components sharing IDH1- mutations as early event may provide insight into the tumorigenesis of true mixed gliomas .

In this report , we show light-mediated activation of the promoter of AtPol\u03bb gene , a homolog of mammalian DNA polymerase \u03bb in Arabidopsis thaliana and an important component of DNA damage repair/recombination machinery in plants . Analyses of the light-mediated promoter activity using various deletion versions of AtPol\u03bb promoter in transformed Arabidopsis and tobacco ( Nicotiana tabaccum ) plants indicate that a 130-bp promoter region between -536 and -408 of AtPol\u03bb promoter is essential for light-induced regulation of AtPol\u03bb expression . DNA-protein interaction studies reveal that an ATCT-motif and AE-box light-responsive elements in the light-regulated promoter region confer light responsiveness of AtPol\u03bb promoter . DNA-binding analysis has identified a 63-kDa trans-acting protein factor which showed specific binding to ATCT-motif , while another trans-acting factor of kDa was found to bind specifically to both ATCT and AE-box sequences . The 52-kDa protein has been identified as B3-domain transcription factor by MALDI-TOF/MS analysis . Overall , our results provide novel information on the role of light signaling in regulation of expression of an important component of DNA repair machinery in plants .

Here we explore the contribution of NF-kappaB to the malignant phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells in addition to its anti-apoptotic role . Block of NF-kappaB signalling by non-destructible IkappaBalpha rendered cells resistant to TGF-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . In contrast , NF-kappaB activation by TNF-alpha or expression of constitutively active IKK2 induced an EMT-phenotype with up-regulation of vimentin and ZEB1 , and down-regulation of E-cadherin . EMT could also be induced in cells with defective TGF-beta signalling . Functional assays demonstrated reduced or strongly enhanced migration and invasion upon NF-kappaB inhibition or activation , respectively .

To test this hypothesis , we used a retroviral vector to express IGFBP-rP1 cDNA in the IGFBP-rP1-deficient MCF-7 breast cancer cell line . Compared with control vector-transduced cells , cumulative cell numbers for IGFBP-rP1-transduced polyclonal or clonal cell cultures were reduced by 39 and 74% , respectively , after 1 week . Medium conditioned by IGFBP-rP1-producing cultures reduced cumulative cell numbers in parental MCF-7 cultures by 20% compared with medium from cultures of a control vector-transduced cell line . Nuclear fragmentation analysis and cell proliferation assays completed in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone excluded apoptosis as the responsible mechanism . The percentage of cells containing senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity was doubled compared with control cell cultures . Flow cytometry analysis indicated that twice as many noncycling cells were present in the IGFBP-rP1-transduced MCF-7 cell cultures compared with controls . These findings indicate that IGFBP-rP1 is an inhibitor of MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation and may act via a cellular senescence-like mechanism .

TCDD inhibits immunoglobulin secretion and decreases resistance to bacterial , viral , and parasitic infections in exposed animals . Nearly 20 years after the Seveso , Italy , accident , we measured immunoglobulin and complement plasma levels in a random sample of the population in the most highly exposed zones ( n = 62 ) and in the surrounding noncontaminated area ( n = 58 ) . Plasma IgG levels decreased with increasing TCDD plasma concentration ( r = -0.35 , p = 0.0002 ) . Median IgG concentration decreased from 1,526 mg/dL in the group with the lowest ( < 3.5 ppt ) TCDD levels to 1,163 mg/dL in the group with the highest ( 20.1-89.9 ppt ) TCDD levels ( p = 0.002 ) . The association was significant ( p = 0.0004 ) after adjusting for age , sex , smoking , and consumption of domestic livestock and poultry in multiple regression analysis and persisted after exclusion of subjects with inflammatory diseases and those using antibiotics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . IgM , IgA , C3 , and C4 plasma concentrations did not exhibit any consistent association with TCDD levels . We performed a systematic review of all the articles published between 1966 and 2001 on human subjects exposed to TCDD reporting information on circulating levels of immunoglobulins and/or complement components . The literature indicates that the evidence for effects of TCDD on humoral immunity is sparse . Methodologic issues , results , and possible sources of variation between studies are discussed . The possible long-term immunologic effects of TCDD exhibited by the participants of the present study , coupled with the increased incidence of lymphatic tumors in the area of the accident , warrant further investigation .

This has been proposed to explain the epidemiological association between higher consumption of fruits and vegetables , which are rich in antioxidants , and lower incidence of cancer . However , this remains to be demonstrated conclusively . The effects of carotenoid supplementation on 1 ) baseline DNA damage , 2 ) susceptibility of cellular DNA to oxidative attack , and 3 ) DNA repair were measured in the human lymphocyte cell line Molt-17 . Baseline DNA damage , susceptibility to oxidant attack ( 100 mumol/l H2O2 for 5 min at 4 degrees C ) , and disappearance of DNA single-strand breaks ( SSB ) after oxidative challenge were monitored by single-cell gel electrophoresis . DNA repair patch synthesis activity in cell extracts was determined using assays that measure nucleotide incorporation during repair of oxidative lesions in template DNA . Unlike single-cell gel electrophoresis , the parameters measured with these assays are not dependent on strand break religation . There was no evidence that beta-carotene , lutein , or beta-cryptoxanthin supplementation protected cellular DNA from oxidation under basal conditions or after oxidative challenge . However , only carotenoid-supplemented cells exhibited a significant decrease in numbers of SSB over a 2-h period after treatment with H2O2 . Carotenoid supplementation did not provoke any detectable change in repair patch synthesis activity . We conclude that supplementation with carotenoids at 8 mumol/l does not provide significant antioxidant protection for DNA in Molt-17 lymphocytes but may enhance recovery of cells from oxidative challenge , as measured by loss of SSB . We argue that these data are most consistent with carotenoids acting to enhance DNA strand break repair .

To evaluate potential medical therapies for these tumors , we have established a quantifiable orthotopic model for NF2-deficient meningiomas . We showed that telomerase-immortalized Ben-Men-1 benign meningioma cells harbored a single nucleotide deletion in NF2 exon 7 and did not express the NF2 protein , merlin . We also demonstrated that AR-42 , a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor , inhibited proliferation of both Ben-Men-1 and normal meningeal cells by increasing expression of p16INK4A , p21CIP1/WAF1 , and p27KIP1 . Also , AR-42 increased pro-apoptotic Bim expression and decreased anti-apoptotic BclXL levels . However , AR-42 predominantly arrested Ben-Men-1 cells at G2/M , while inducing cell-cycle arrest at G1 in meningeal cells . Consistently , AR-42 substantially decreased the levels of cyclin D1 , E , and A , and PCNA in meningeal cells while significantly reducing the expression of cyclin B , important for progression through G2 , in Ben-Men-1 cells . In addition , AR-42 decreased Aurora A and B expression . To compare the in vivo efficacies of AR-42 and AR-12 , a PDK1 inhibitor , we generated and used luciferase-expressing Ben-Men-1-LucB cells to establish intracranial xenografts that grew over time . While AR-12 treatment moderately slowed tumor growth , AR-42 caused regression of Ben-Men-1-LucB tumors . Importantly , AR-42-treated tumors showed minimal regrowth when xenograft-bearing mice were switched to normal diet . Together , these results suggest that AR-42 is a potential therapy for meningiomas . The differential effect of AR-42 on cell-cycle progression of normal meningeal and meningioma cells may have implications for why AR-42 is well-tolerated while it potently inhibits tumor growth .
